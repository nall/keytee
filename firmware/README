In order to install a bootloader and to set the fuses, connect GND,
5V, RST, SCLK, MISO, and MOSI to a USBasp programmer; then,

$ make bootloader-dfu
$ make fuses



With the bootloader in place, plug the keytee USB terminal into your
computer.  You may have to initiate RESET by connecting RST to GND.
Then, build and upload firmware:

$ make dfu
