keytee -- Controller breakout board for small keyboards

Keytee is based on the ATMEGA32U2 controller.  With its 20 usable I/O
pins, it can drive keyboards with up to 100 keys.  The PCB is intended
to sit between the switches of a mechanical keyboard, not adding any
bulk; cf. http://imgur.com/v3vOg1i.


./pcb/ contains the hardware design as a KiCAD project.

TMK-based ./firmware/ defines a 10-row, 10-column keymap with a total
of 10 keys that exercise all the hardware pins.  It is meant for
hardware testing and should probably adapted to any specific
requirements.
